            <P>Honey badgers ironically named so sweetly are incredibly aggressive vicious mammals. With numerous options of defense 
        strategies. One of its best defense is its incredibly tough skin its capable of resisting some bites and attempts to pierce it.
        These vicious mammals have been know to fight back when prey upon by lions, hyenas and other larger mammals. Snakes such a cobras 
        are just breakfast for a honey badger its resiliant skin hangs loosely allowing quick manuevers if predators latch on.</P>
