        <p>If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;<br>
        If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But make allowance for their doubting too;<br>
        If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br>
        Or, being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;<br>
        </p>

        <p>
        If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;<br>
        If you can meet with triumph and disaster<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And treat those two impostors just the same;<br>
        If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
        Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stoop and build ’em up with wornout tools;<br>
        </p>
