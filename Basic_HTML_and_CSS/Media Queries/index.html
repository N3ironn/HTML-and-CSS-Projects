        <h5>Athletes and Plant Based Nutrition</h5>
            <p>When you’re eating high amounts of meat you’re taking in a lot of saturated fat and that can affect your heart health. A plant-based diet might actually give endurance athletes an extra competitive edge when it comes to their heart health. Not only is it helping their heart health but is also proven to reduce blood pressure and cholesterol. Although there is no proof that a vegan diet can help with an athlete’s overall skill, it does help with their endurance.

            If you’ve watched the Netflix documentary ‘The Game-Changers’ produced by Arnold Schwarzenegger funnily enough, you will see how athletes who have turned to veganism have had their best performance once they’ve changed to a plant-based diet. Athletes are also crediting plant-based diets for shorter recovery times. Recovery time for athletes is important, not only does it help enhance endurance and performance, but it is also crucial for restoring the body and helping prevent muscle-related injuries from occurring. According to a study because a vegan diet requires you to eat more vegetables and carbohydrates such as legumes, fruits, etc it aids in a quicker recovery time than those who eat an omnivore diet, because of plant’s anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>
