        <p>As an individual I believe quality work is the fasted work. If you break it down logically, when you do a job once and perfect you never 
            Have to return to fix your mistakes this saves you time and hassles of claims, loss of clients and damage of reputation saving on all future marketing efforts. 
            You really almost never need to market people will spread the word. Thats when you can name your price because you come prequalified and your reputation for quality presedes you.
        </p>

    <p>Affluent people love quality. Be a quality provider of a service and you can become affluent if done properly and honestly</p>
