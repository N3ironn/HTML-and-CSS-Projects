        <p>As an individual I believe quality work is the fasted work. If you break it down logically,
            when you do a job once and perfect you never Have to return to fix your mistakes. 
            This saves you time, hassle of claims, loss of clients and damage to your reputation. Saving on all future marketing efforts. 
            You really almost never need to market, people will spread the word about you.
            Thats when you can name your price, because you come prequalified and your reputation for quality presedes you.
        </p>

    <p>Affluent people love quality. Be a quality provider of a service and you can become affluent if done properly and honestly</p>
